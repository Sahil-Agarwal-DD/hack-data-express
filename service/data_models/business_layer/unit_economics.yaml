          description: Marqueta undercharge expense that DD ultimately pays for. This is in the case of red card usage where the in-app menu price is cheaper than the actual swiped amount in store. The delta is covered by DD instead of passed back to the consumer.Additionally, there are also situations where our app menu prices are overstated and we charge the customer more. Thus, we end up refunding the difference to the customer. This is an offset instead of a true cost to the P&L because gross fees will have the benefit of the overcharge.
